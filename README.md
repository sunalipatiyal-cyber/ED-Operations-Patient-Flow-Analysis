# Emergency Department (ED) Operations & Patient Flow Dashboard

🏥 Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing clinical throughput and hospital resource management. Using a dataset of 9,216 patient records, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor operational performance and identify bottlenecks in patient care.


📊 Key Insights & Impact
Throughput Optimization: Analyzed flow dynamics to identify a 34.9-minute mean wait time and a 49.5% admission velocity.

Temporal Demand Analysis: Identified peak congestion windows on Saturdays and during overnight shifts, providing data for evidence-based staffing.

Operational Efficiency: Mapped departmental referral patterns to improve bed capacity planning for Orthopedics and General Practice.

Data Engineering: Performed end-to-end data transformation in Power Query to ensure 100% reporting accuracy across a 19-month period.


🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Power BI Desktop: End-to-end report development.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Created custom measures for Wait Times and Admission Rates.

Power Query (M): Cleaned and structured raw clinical data.
